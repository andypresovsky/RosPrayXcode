And after this, our exile, show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus. O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary. Pray for us, O holy Mother of God, that we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ. Amen.

O GOD, WHOSE: 

O God, whose only-begotten Son by His life, death and resurrection, has purchased for us the rewards of eternal life; grant, we beseech Thee, that by meditating upon these mysteries of the Most Holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary, we may imitate what they contain and obtain what they promise, through the same Christ our Lord. Amen.

MEMORARE: 

Remember oh most Blessed Virgin Mary that never was it known, that anyone who fled to your protection, implored your help, or sought your intercession, was left unaided. Inspired by this confidence, we fly unto thee, oh virgin of virgins, our Mother. To you do we come, before you we stand, sinful and sorrowful. Oh mother of the Word Incarnate, despise not our petitions, but in your mercy, hear and answer them. Amen.

		<string>Apostle’s creed:

I believe in God, the Father Almighty, 
Creator of Heaven and earth; 
and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, Our Lord, 
Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, 
born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, 
was crucified, died, and was buried. 

He descended into Hell. 
The third day He arose again from the dead; 
He ascended into Heaven, sitteth at the right hand of God, the Father Almighty; 
from thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead. 

I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. 

Amen.</string>

		<string>The Creed: The Symbol of Faith

I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven and Earth and of all things visible and invisible.

And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the only-begotten, begotten of the Father before all ages. 

Light of light; true God of true God; begotten, not made; of one essence with the Father, by Whom all things were made; 

Who for us men and for our salvation came down from Heaven, and was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary, and became man. 

And He was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered, and was buried. 

And the third day He arose again, according to the Scriptures, and ascended into Heaven, and sits at the right hand of the Father; and He shall come again with glory to judge the living and the dead; Whose Kingdom shall have no end.

And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of Life, Who proceeds from the Father; Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; Who spoke by the prophets.

In one Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church. 

I acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins. I look for the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come. 
Amen.</string>
